# Omegle Location Finder
Find anyone's location on Omegle using this code

## Pre-requisites:

1. In the JavaScript code, inside the function `fetchLocation(ip)`, change the token ID to your token.
2. This is because each token is differently linked to the API.
3. You can easily get your token for free on `hhtps://iplocation.io/`

## Method : 

1. Go to the Omegle website.
2. Press `Ctrl+shift+I` to `inspect element`.
3. In the `console`, clear all the pre-existing data by clicking the circle with a slanting dash in it.
4. Paste the given JavaScript code in the `console` and press `enter`.
5. Start a video/ voice chat and see the magic ;)
